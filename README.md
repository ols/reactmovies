# reactmovies
Just a tiny webb application to try out <a href="http://reactjs.net/">reactjs.net</a> using <a href="http://api.myapifilms.com/">api.myapifilms.com</a> to simply fetch imdb movies by title and display with some bootstrap. Using <a href="http://www.ninject.org/">ninject</a> as dependency injector.

To try it yourself you'll have to get a api key by submitting your email to: http://api.myapifilms.com/ and setup web.config with:
appSettings -> myappfilmsApiKey: key
